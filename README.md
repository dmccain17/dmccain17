- Hi, Iâ€™m Devon McCain
- The project that I have created is a grocery tracker and it would track groceries. This is made of C++ and Python Code.
- I think that I created code that was easy to read and has great functionality.
- I could have improved on finding a way to make the code more secure to avoid any hacking issues for the company.
- I honestly had a difficult time writing with both Python and C++. It was a challenging adventure. I used many sources such as youtube videos and reddit for advice.
- This can easily translate into other proects since I would have a better understanding of how to work with two different types of code, as many programs consist of two programming languages.
- The way that I made this program so readable, adaptable, and maintainable, is by following a consistent coding pattern and to add plenty of comments for the understanding of others who many view my code.
